# VenomWSL

Venom Linux on WSL2 powered by [wsldl](https://github.com/yuk7/wsldl).

## Disclaimer

THIS REPO IS NOT AFFILIATE TO THE OFFICIAL "VENOM LINUX" DISTRIBUTION IN ANY WAY!

## Install

1. Download installer zip from [releases](https://github.com/Vinfall/VenomWSL/releases/action-build)
2. (Optinally) verify hash to avoid file corruption
3. Extract all files in zip file to same directory (e.g. `D:\WSL\Venom`)
4. Run `Venom.exe` to extract rootfs and Register to WSL

`Venom.exe` is used as WSL distro label.
It's possible to have multiple installs by renaming it to something like `Vemon.exe`.

## Init

```sh
# Update system to latest as it's rolling release
scratch sync
scratch outdate
scratch sysup -y
# Check integrity just in case
scratch integrity
# Check broken packages
revdep
```

Then follow [Configuring system](https://venomlinux.org/wiki#installation.configuring-system).
Skip things like fstab, kernel and bootloader as WSL covers that already.
You don't need to enter chroot environment as well
since the installation (importing the tarball) is done during [#Install](#install).

You may also want to enable `nonfree` repo in [`/etc/scratch.repo`](https://venomlinux.org/wiki#package-manager.etcscratchpkgrepo)
and setup package aliases in [`/etc/scratchpkg.alias`](https://venomlinux.org/wiki#package-manager.etcscratchpkgalias)
to avoid compiling certain packages from source.

For example, use rust binary as compiling is resource consuming.

```sh
echo 'rust rust-bin' | sudo tee -a /etc/scratchpkg.alias
```

## Build

VenomWSL can be built on GNU/Linux or WSL.

`curl`, `bsdtar`, `jq` and `unzip` is required for build.

By default it builds s6 variant.
To use SysV/runit, change `$(BASE_URL_S6)` respectively in [Makefile](Makefile).

```bash
# Install build tools
sudo apt install -y curl libarchive-tools jq unzip
# Make release
# Use `sudo` here as partitions mounted via WSL are owned by current user
# (e.g. UID 1000) but rootfs requires root aka. UID 0
sudo make
# Clean-up using `sudo` as some files are owned by root
sudo make clean
```

## Backup

It's suggested to compact the volume first as WSL does not free the space automatically:

```powershell
wsl --shutdown
cd "path\to\WSL\Venom"
# requires Hyper-V feature
Optimize-VHD -Path .\ext4.vhdx -Mode Retrim -Confirm -Whatif # dry run
Optimize-VHD -Path .\ext4.vhdx -Mode Retrim -Confirm
```

`wsldl backup` mentioned in [#Usage](#usage) is recommended
as it does not require extra tools,
but you can use whatever method you like.

You can use native `wsl --export` + zstd to compress much faster:

```powershell
wsl --shutdown
# you need to install ZSTD on Windows (NOT inside WSL!)
cmd /c "wsl --export Venom - | zstd -T0 -o Venom-$(Get-Date -UFormat "%Y%m%d").tar.zst"
```

It's even possible to use bash+zstd via [cosmoscc][cosmoscc]
to avoid ZSTD on Windows or PowerlessShell:

```sh
bash-5.2$ wsl.exe --export Venom - | zstd -T0 -o ./Venom-$(date +'%Y%m%d').tar.zst
```
